# My AWS Learning Journey :- A 25-Day Roadmap to Cloud Mastery
Embarking on the journey to master AWS has been both an exciting and transformative experience. Over the course of 25 days, I immersed myself in a structured learning path that covered fundamental concepts, practical applications, and advanced techniques. This detailed account of my AWS learning journey aims to share the knowledge and insights I gained, as well as to inspire others who are on a similar path.
## Introduction to AWS and Linux Fundamentals
The journey began with an introduction to AWS and its global infrastructure, providing a solid foundation of how cloud services operate. I quickly delved into the AWS Management Console, exploring its various features and understanding how to navigate the platform.                                           
Simultaneously, I strengthened my Linux command-line skills, which are crucial for managing AWS instances. I mastered commands such as mv for renaming files, rm for removing files, rmdir for directory removal, vi for file editing, grep for searching within files, less for filtering, head and tail for viewing file content, sort for organizing data, sed for stream editing, find for locating files, and chmod for managing file permissions became crucial for managing instances and ensuring security. I also delved into user and group level administration and access modes, laying a solid groundwork for my AWS management tasks. Understanding user and group level administration and access modes laid the groundwork for efficient system management.
## Setting Up and Managing EC2 Instances
One of the pivotal aspects of my learning was launching and managing EC2 instances. This hands-on experience involved creating security groups to define inbound and outbound traffic rules, configuring SSH and RDP connections, and deploying both Linux and Windows servers. These skills are fundamental for anyone looking to leverage the power of AWS for scalable and flexible computing resources.
## Deploying Web Servers and Exploring EBS
With EC2 instances up and running, I deployed Apache servers on Linux, launching sample websites to understand the importance of HTTP rules and configurations. This practical exercise highlighted the need for proper security measures and efficient server management.                             
Exploring Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) was another critical step. I learned to create, attach, rename, and extend volumes and manage disk partitions. This knowledge is essential for ensuring scalable and resilient storage solutions. Understanding the practical aspects of EBS allowed me to enhance my storage management capabilities effectively.
